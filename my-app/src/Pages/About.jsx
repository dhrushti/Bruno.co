<h2>
    GLOBAL BRAND WITH GERMAN ROOTS
</h2>
<p>
    BRUNO CO is a global brand. BRUNO CO is one of the most well known German brands in the world. With around 3,000 employees, this tradition-rich, sixth-generation family-owned business is also one of the largest employers in the German clothing industry. More than 1,100 new jobs have been created since the beginning of 2013, almost all of them in Germany. This is because BRUNO CO produces most of its products at its own production facilities in Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and Saxony.
<br/>
<br/>
BRUNO CO has been a global player since the 1970s. Our products are sold in some 90 countries on all continents. And our organization is becoming increasingly international as well. BRUNO CO has eight locations in Germany. Internationally, we are represented with sales offices in the United States, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Denmark, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom.

<h2>

    We create products that make the lives of our customers easier and better. BRUNO CO stands for excellent comfort, high functionality, and extraordinary quality. The high level of quality is the result of carefully selected, high-quality materials from sustainable sources that are processed under what are for our brand typically demanding conditions. Our products promote wellbeing. They literally do good. So they stand out from the flood of cheap products that dominate large parts of our consumer world today.
